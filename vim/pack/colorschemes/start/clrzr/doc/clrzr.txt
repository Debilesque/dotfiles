TRUE COLOR SUPPORT

Works in gVim or any terminal with true-color support.  If your terminal
supports 24-bit color, but you are not seeing the colors, add the following
lines to your `vimrc` and restart:

  let &t_8f = "\e[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum" " sets foreground color (ANSI true-color mode)
  let &t_8b = "\e[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum" " sets background color (ANSI true-color mode)
  set termguicolors

USAGE

This plugin defines three commands:

  *:ClrzrOn*      - enable color highlighting in all windows
  *:ClrzrOff*     - disable color highlighting in all windows
  *:ClrzrAposTog* - toggle alpha position for hex colors in current buffer
  *:ClrzrRefresh* - refresh highlights in current buffer

                                                        *'g:clrzr_startup'*
If you don't want to enable clrzr at startup, set the following:

  let g:clrzr_startup = 0

                                                       *'g:clrzr_maxlines'*
You can limit parsing of long buffers.  For example, with this set:

  let g:clrzr_maxlines = 1000

it will only parse color syntax for highlights up to 1000th line.  Syntax
beyond the 1000th line may still inherit a highlight parsed between lines
1 and 1000.

-1 means an unlimited number of lines

                                                *'g:clrzr_hex_alpha_first'*
There are color strings in the format #RRGGBBAA and #AARRGGBB. The former is
more common so it's the default. If you want the latter, set the following:

  let g:clrzr_hex_alpha_first = 1

You can toggle the recognized alpha position with :ClrzrAposTog.

Note: if you modify a color string in normal mode, if the cursor is still on
that line, it'll take 'updatetime' seconds to update. You can use
:ClrzrRefresh (or your key mapping) again to force update.
